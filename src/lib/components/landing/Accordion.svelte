			<span
				>Well, the story behind the duck is quite interesting! I'm a very hands-on person. Ever
				since I was a kid, my curiosity led me to take my toys apart, which later evolved into a
				simple philosophy: if I can fix something, I will. To this day, my friends still call me to
				borrow tools, assemble furniture, or change a shower head—a real handyman. This philosophy
				also grew into a desire to build my own things, and nothing enables that more than the world
				of programming.</span
			>

			<span
				>This is where the duck comes into the story, and it's no coincidence. On a trip to Paris, I
				came across a shop that only sold rubber ducks, which reminded me of the famous "rubber duck
				debugging" method. To my delight, I found an item that perfectly merged my passion for
				programming with my life philosophy: the DIY Duck from Budduck (an amazing store, by the
				way!).</span
